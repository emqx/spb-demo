Recommended actoins

Check your program pointer and move it if necessary.
Reduce the speed.

2 Restore system to the previous state using a snapshot.
3 Perform a complete reinstallation of the RobotWare system using RobotWare Installation Utilities.

## 10457, Event routines are deferred

Description

The arg event routine arg in task arg could not start. Executions of event routines are deferred until next start order for this task.

## 10458, System state could not be restored after RobotWare system update

Description

Under normal circumstances, previous system state is automatically reloaded after the system has been updated. Loading the state has in this case failed and the system has therefore been reset and started with an empty configuration.

Consequences

All user programs and system parameters prior to the system update must be manually reloaded.

 
Probable causes

In some scenarios, such as removing or adding certain optional features or major upgrades of installed software products versions, the previous system state may be incompatible with the newly reconfigured system. An event log file has been saved in the home directory and may help to identify the incompatible configuration that is causing the problem.

Recommended actoins

Proposed alternatives:

Continue using the updated system and reimplement your programs and configuration, e.g. by selectively reloading contents of a previous valid backup. Use a snapshot to restore a previous valid system state. Perform a complete reinstallation of the RobotWare system using RobotWare Installation Utilities and then reload a valid backup.

## 10459, System restored from a snapshot

Description

System state has been restored from a snapshot.

Consequences

System state has been reverted to a previous point in time. This includes installed software products, system internal state, user and AddIns data.

## 50483, Movement in wrong direction

Description

Moving from current to target position when opening arg gave a movement in wrong direction.

Consequences

The motion force control has to move the mechanical unit back to the starting position it had when taking over from the position control, before handing back the control to the position control. In this case the starting position for the force movement is more closed than current position is and that will lead to closing movement before position control can take over. The situation indicate that there was a collision with the plate during the closing movement, that the plate thickness is not correct, or that the calibration is not correct.
